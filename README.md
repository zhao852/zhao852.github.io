#### Implemented a binary decision tree using the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 algorithm and ran it against a titanic survivor dataset, considering 7 attributes such as class of travel, age, fare, etc. The first attribute "survived" is the class label.

#### The review sentiment analyzer takes in a training and testing dataset with a positive and negative review on each line. After cleaning the data, each word is analyzed and assigned a weight based on its frequency and its occurrences in positive vs negative reviews. A final "score" is calculated for each input review. The user inputs a sentence and the program will tell you if that review would be considered positive or negative in human language. Based on my testing dataset there is usually ~85% accuracy.

#### The perceptron classification project uses the same dataset as the decision tree. Similar analysis but with perceptron.
