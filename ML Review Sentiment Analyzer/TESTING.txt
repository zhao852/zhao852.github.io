Pros:-Good camera - very nice pictures , also has cool styles like black and white, and more.	1
Lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone.	1
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0

Nice docking station for home or work.	1
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.	1
Not impressed.	0

Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!	0
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	0
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.	1
After my phone got to be about a year old, it's been slowly breaking despite much care on my part.	0
Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.	1
Plan on ordering from them again and again.	1
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.	0
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.	1
I want my money back.	0
Does everything it should and more.	1
Truly awful.	0

I am also very happy with the price.	1
I am pairing this with my iphone, and I could not be happier with it so far.	1

Very wind-resistant.	1
Not enough volume.	0
Good audio quality.	1
What possesed me to get this junk, I have no idea...	0
i got this phone around the end of may and i'm completely unhappy with it.	0
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.	0
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers.	0
Also, the phone doesn't seem to accept anything except CBR mp3s, preferably ripped by Windows Media Player.	0
Do NOT buy if you want to use the holster.	0
Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.	1
Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!	0
Display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year.	1
For the price on Amazon, it is an excellent product, which I would highly recommend.	1
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.	0
It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.	1
They do not care about the consumer one bit.	0
Reception is terrible and full of static.	0
I am sorry I made this purchase.	0
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.	0
It has been a winner for us.	1

Battery lasts only a few hours.	0
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.	1
Bad Reception.	0
Very much disappointed with this company.	0
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.	0
Bad Choice.	0
Pretty piece of junk.	0
I only hear garbage for audio.	0
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.	0
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.	0
Lasted one day and then blew up.	0
Battery life is also great!	1
Disappointed!.	0
My phone doesn't slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand.	1
It feels poorly constructed, the menus are difficult to navigate, and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them.	0
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.	0
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.	0
It's a great item.	1
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.	0
It was quite comfortable in the ear.	1
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.	0
Not good enough for the price.	0
what a disappointment	0
Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone.	0
The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.	0
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	0
wont work right or atleast for me.	0
It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.	0
I got it because it was so small and adorable.	1
It didn't charge for me.	0
I bought two of them and neither will charge.	0
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.	0
WORTHWHILE.	1
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !	0
All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase.	1
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.	0
I'm very disappointed with my decision.	0
That being said, for a phone, the camera is very nice; many cool effects to play with, and video is decent as well.	1
I would recommend it.	1
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.	1
This one works and was priced right.	1
Unfortunately it did not work.	0
I've dropped my phone more times than I can say, even on concrete and my phone is still great (knock on wood!).	1
sucked, most of the stuff does not work with my phone.	0
It worked very well.	1
I love my 350 headset.. My Jabra350 bluetooth headset is great, the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit.	1
I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.	1
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.	0
All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.The more I use the thing the less I like it.	0
Very good phone.	1
Worst Customer Service Ever.	0
(It works!)	1
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!	1
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.	1
Internet is excrutiatingly slow.	0
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.	1
They keep getting better and better (this is my third one and I've had numerous Palms too).	1
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.	1
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.	1
You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered.	0
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	1
What a waste.	0
The file browser offers all the options that one needs.Handsfree is great.	1
Reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable, and the send and end keys are not where I expect them to be.3.	0
Its the best headset I have used.	1
Mic Doesn't work.	0
All it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was cracked.I am not impressed and I am not laughing.	0
Battery is terrible.	0
Battery life is real good.	1
The phone loads super!	1
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.	1
The biggest complaint I have is, the battery drains superfast.	0
This case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear, it is 100% functional.	1
So far it has worked like a charm.	1
W810i is just SUPERB.	1
Iam very pleased with my purchase.	1
AMAZON SUCKS.	0
Keep up the good work Amazon!!	1
2 thumbs up to this seller	1
The battery works great!	1
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.	0
Would not reccommend.	0
Don't bother - go to the store.	0
Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.	1
Avoid this one if you can.	0
Disappointed with battery.	0
Horrible phone.	0
I would recommend this.	1
The cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly.	1
This phone works great.	1

Clear Skype Calls, Long Battery Life, Long Range.	1
Good case!.	1
VERY DISAPPOINTED.	0
Restored my phone to like new performance.	1
Great for iPODs too.	1
If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.	0
best bluetooth on the market.	1
the only VERY DISAPPOINTING thing was there was NO SPEAKERPHONE!!!!	0
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.	1
VERY comfortable.	1
Arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold.	1
The mic there is a joke, and the volume is quite low.	0
I'm still infatuated with this phone.	1
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.	0
My headset works just peachy-keen.	1
I give Wirefly 1 star.I will contact Cingular/AT&T; and inform them of this practice.	0
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.	1
doesn't last long.	0
It works fine on my Motorola 325 cellphone, and a lot better than the worn-out battery did.	1
Great charger.	1
It's a great tool for entertainment, communication, and data management.Oh, be sure to use ActiveSync 4.2 for optimal data synchronization results!	1
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.	0
Doesn't hold charge.	0
Last time buying from you.	0
Don't buy this product.	0
Exactly what I wanted.	1
I am very happy	1
This is a great deal.	1
Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.	1
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.	0
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.	0
I'm pleased.	1
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!	0
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.	0
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.	1
Nice Sound.	1
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.	0
I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.	0
This is infuriating.	0
disappointing.	0
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.	1
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.	0
Overall, I am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception.	1
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.	1
I have read other's reviews here but I haven't had any problem with it.	1
It's AGGRAVATING!	0
Disapointing Results.	0
It's pretty easy.	1
The calls drop, the phone comes on and off at will, the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently.	0
Great software for Motorolas.	1
Great phone.	1
Perfect for the PS3.	1
A week later after I activated it, it suddenly died.	0
It has everything I need and I couldn't ask for more.	1
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.	0
This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.	0
Comfortable in my hand.	1
How stupid is that?	0
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	1
I had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 Blackberry Curve!	1
Nice solid keyboard.	1
I have had TMobile service for 2 or 3 years now, and I am pretty happy with it.	1
My colleague & I now get great reception.A little expensive, but performance is great.	1
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.	1
Clear crisp sound.	1
The buttons for on and off are bad.	0
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.	0
There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.	0
Very Dissapointing Performance.	0
Worst customer service.	0
Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.	1
Magical Help.	1
This phone might well be the worst I've ever had in any brand.	0
Don't make the same mistake I did.	0
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.	0
Doesn't Work.	0
It is the best charger I have seen on the market yet.	1
Piece of trash.	0
Poor product.	0
Dont waste your money...	0
don't waste your money.	0
)Setup couldn't have been simpler.	1
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.	1
:-)Oh, the charger seems to work fine.	1
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.	0
Despite the pans of reviewers, I liked this movie.  	1
The opening sequence of this gem is a classic, and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch.  	1
And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  	0
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	1
This movie has a cutting edge to it.  	1
That was funny.  	1
Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  	0
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0
Also, it's a real treat to see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse.  	1
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  	0
Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	1
Highly recommended A+  	1
Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  	0
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  	0
The movie is not completely perfect but 'Titta Di Girolamo' will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie.  	1
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  	1
I gave it a 10  	1
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  	1
Avoid at ALL costs!  	0
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	1
As they say in Canada, This is the fun game, aye.  	1
It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.  	1
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1
My rating: just 3 out of 10.  	0
If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  	0
I love the Scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there.  	1
The Wind and the Lion is well written and superbly acted.  	1
Simply beautiful.  	1
The camera really likes her in this movie.  	1
Having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt.  	1
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  	0
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	0
It was too predictable, even for a chick flick.  	0
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	1
Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	1
The visual effects were AWFUL.  	0
This is just a great movie.  	1
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  	0
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	1
This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  	0
Being a 90's child, I truly enjoyed this show and I can proudly say that I enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical WB cartoons.  	1
People who like European films and "art movies" will like this movie.  	1
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	1
This is actually a very smart movie.  	1
Even the squibs look awful.  	0
An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	1
The acting was decidely wooden, though no worse than a period Universal B movie.  	0
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  	1
Definitely worth checking out.  	1
The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  	0
The "explosion" of the Gas tanks at the end was just as awful.  	0
Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1
I guess I liked the details of his dysfunction--he was believable.  	1
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	1
This is high adventure at its best.  	1
Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  	0
This was one of the worst films i have ever seen.  	0
It deserves strong love.  	1
I'll put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, or any other aspect of film-making.  	1
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  	0
The film is well paced, understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.  	1
He owns the film, just as Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" and Quaid owned "Great Balls of Fire.  	1
This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  	1
The aerial scenes were well-done.  	1
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  	0
It felt like a very gripping, intelligent stage play (but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage) which plays on everyone's terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences.  	1
Then I watched it again two Sundays ago (March 20th, 2005) and I began to really enjoy it and this time I taped the entire thing.  	1
The characters are fleshed out surprisingly well, particularly Grimes and Blake, and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic.  	1
Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  	1
My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot.  	1
The attention given to every character, and complex psychological portrayals, detailing loyalty, treachery, love, and hope, are tremendous.  	1
Camerawork - again, bad.  	0
Babie Bop is very cute.  	1
The only place good for this film is in the garbage.  	0
I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	1
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  	1
10/10  	1
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  	0
There are some generally great things in it.  	1
This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  	1
I just saw this film and I recommend it.  	1
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  	0
Too politically correct.  	0
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  	0
This may be the only bad film he ever made.  	0
The casting is also horrible, cause all you see is a really really BAD Actors, period.  	0
It's very slow.  	0
I advise you to look out for it.  	1
The characters are interesting, even if a bit predictable.  	1
Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	1
This is an excellent film.  	1
This movie is BAD.  	0
Hopefully, the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast, or win us over with a whole new film.  	1
The plot, such as it is, is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing.  	0
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  	1
" With great sound effects, and impressive special effects, I can't recommend this movie enough.  	1
For that, it's worth checking out.  	1
I don't know what happened in Season Five, what a mess.  	0
It is zillion times away from reality.  	0
All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  	1
Brilliance indeed.  	1
Considering the relations off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them.  	0
If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of "The Way You Look Tonight"), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  	1
Kris Kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference.  	1
It is not good.  	0
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  	0
Tom Wilkinson's character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin, but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses, and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the character's anguish and suffering.  	1
The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	1
But the acting--even that of such professionals as Drago and Debbie Rochon--was terrible, the directing worse (perhaps contributory to the former), the dialog chimp-like, and the camera work, barely tolerable.  	0
Actually, the graphics were good at the time.  	1
This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	1
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show.  	0
This film offers many delights and surprises.  	1
The sets are so bad, they wouldn't look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode.  	0
I was very uneasy with how bad this movie was, but not scared at all.  	0
It was also the right balance of war and love.  	1
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  	0
I am a fan of his ... This movie sucked really bad.  	0
The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	0
The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the sinister origins of the puppets.  	0
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	0
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
Also notable is John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design & costumes by Eiko Ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well deserved Oscar.  	1
Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	0
Very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the Oscar shortlist.  	0
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  	0
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1
There still are good actors around!  	1
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  	1
I'm glad the film didn't go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have.  	1
The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	1
Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  	1
NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  	0
It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	1
This movie totally grates on my nerves.  	0
That was nice.  	1
Her role was played well.  	1
No plot whatsoever!  	0
There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	0
(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  	1
The fact is, this film is a wonderful, heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams.  	1
Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  	1
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  	1
Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  	0
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	1
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  	0
If you want a real scare rent this one!  	1
Everything Captain Howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid.  	0
All in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10.  	1
This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  	1
Saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort, good messages for kids.  	1
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	0
10/10  	1
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  	0
If you do watch it, however, there are small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles.  	1
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  	1
The show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for.  	0
" I love it.  	1
The cast is always entertaining as usual.  	1
The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  	1
Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  	0
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  	0
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  	1
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  	1
It crackles with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but honestly, i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly.  	0
Worse, there's an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown in that follows a little band of latter-day Mansonites as they go after a reporter who's working on a story on the anniversary of the killings.  	0
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1
Angus Scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing, violin-playing anatomist Doctor Quinn.  	1
Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy.  	1
God, and I can never get that 90 minutes back!  	0
Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  	0
All in all its an insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money.  	0
It's a campy sort of film that's a joy to watch.  	1
The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  	0
The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  	0
Also the music by Mark Snow is possibly the best score I've ever heard.  	1
It is an insane game.  	1
Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  	0
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  	0
If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  	1
All the characters in this film are tremendously well played.  	1
You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  	0
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0
The film lacks any real scares or tension & some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least & I say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself.  	0
The story line is totally predictable.  	0
It's a mediocre, miserable, hollow, laughable and predictable piece of garbage.  	0
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1
The story line is just awful!  	0
Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  	0
Why was this film made?  	0
I let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this - bad idea, we both hated it.  	0
The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  	0
Unless you're just out to visually "collect" all extant films of Austen's work, you can skip this one.  	0
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  	0
In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  	1
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  	1
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  	0
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  	0
STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  	1
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  	1
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  	1
So for our enjoyment we get to see them run around, play games, and be dangerous.  	1
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  	1
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	1
This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the below-par script, which borrowed much from the earlier classic.  	0
A piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid.  	0
An excellent performance from Ms.  	1
Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  	0
She carries the movie well.  	1
And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	1
I could not understand, what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season.  	0
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0
It was so funny.  	1
If there was ever a movie that needed word-of-mouth to promote, this is it.  	1
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	0
It is a really good show to watch.  	1
The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or build-up in the slightest.  	0
The directing is sloppy at best.  	0
The script is horrendously stupid.  	0
It's just lame.  	0
The results, well, are a shame.  	0
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  	0
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	0
I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  	0
I hate movies like that.  	0
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face, which makes it the more interesting.  	1
Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	1
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  	0
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	1
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  	1
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating.  	1
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  	0
I came out of it feeling angry.  	0
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs.  	0
Excellent performance.  	1
And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	0
One of the worst shows of all time.  	0
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  	1
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	1
Don't waste your time here.	0
The black eyed peas and sweet potatoes... UNREAL!	1
Today was my first taste of a Buldogis Gourmet Hot Dog and I have to tell you it was more than I ever thought possible.	1
This place was such a nice surprise!	1
The Jamaican mojitos are delicious.	1
I hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives.	0
My breakfast was perpared great, with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of Toast, lightly dusted with powdered sugar.	1
At least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving, and it wasn't that busy.	0
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	1
The goat taco didn't skimp on the meat and wow what FLAVOR!	1
Maybe it's just their Vegetarian fare, but I've been twice and I thought it was average at best.	0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
From what my dinner companions told me...everything was very fresh with nice texture and taste.	1
you can watch them preparing the delicious food!)	1
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1
Thoroughly disappointed!	0
The food was excellent and service was very good.	1
The sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well.	1
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
the presentation of the food was awful.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
Once your food arrives it's meh.	0
definitely will come back here again.	1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.	1
Service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is Vegas and located inside the Crystals shopping mall by Aria.	1
I guess I should have known that this place would suck, because it is inside of the Excalibur, but I didn't use my common sense.	0
I will not be eating there again.	0
I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one.	0
I took back my money and got outta there.	0
Very, very sad.	0
The portion was huge!	1
Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	1
One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that.	1
The food is about on par with Denny's, which is to say, not good at all.	0
I probably would not go here again.	0
I'll definitely be in soon again.	1
REAL sushi lovers, let's be honest - Yama is not that good.	0
My drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions.	1
Coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties can't wait for the other person to ask to break up.	0
These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across.	1
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
Lordy, the Khao Soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers!	1
He deserves 5 stars.	1

Tasted like dirt.	0
It was equally awful.	0

The plantains were the worst I've ever tasted.	0
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0
It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	0
Service was good and the company was better!	1
The meat was pretty dry, I had the sliced brisket and pulled pork.	0
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
The servers are not pleasant to deal with and they don't always honor Pizza Hut coupons.	0
What did bother me, was the slow service.	0
I found this place by accident and I could not be happier.	1
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
It shouldn't take 30 min for pancakes and eggs.	0
Our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow, he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go!	1
We were sat right on time and our server from the get go was FANTASTIC!	1
5 stars for the brick oven bread app!	1
Some highlights : Great quality nigiri here!	1
It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.	0
Great food and awesome service!	1

But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat's also pretty rare here in Vegas.	1
The building itself seems pretty neat; the bathroom is pretty trippy, but I wouldn't eat here again.	0
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	0
After waiting an hour and being seated, I was not in the greatest of moods.	0
I won't be back.	0
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	0
The sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was $12, ridiculous.	0
As for the "mains," also uninspired.	0
The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.	1
It'll be a regular stop on my trips to Phoenix!	1
The jalapeno bacon is soooo good.	1
I would recommend saving room for this!	1

We waited an hour for what was a breakfast I could have done 100 times better at home.	0
The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.	1
I kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes, yet still no food.	0
So don't go there if you are looking for good food...	0
Best fish I've ever had in my life!	1
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
I have eaten here multiple times, and each time the food was delicious.	1

It was probably dirt.	0
Go To Place for Gyros.	1
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1
Kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did.	0
I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza.	1

Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	1
A great touch.	1

The staff are now not as friendly, the wait times for being served are horrible, no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes.	0
This place receives stars for their APPETIZERS!!!	1
They also now serve Indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world.	1
I would avoid this place if you are staying in the Mirage.	0

This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
The manager was the worst.	0
Service is friendly and inviting.	1
Best of luck to the rude and non-customer service focused new management.	0
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1

The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.	1
Much better than the other AYCE sushi place I went to in Vegas.	1
We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well.	0
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
Very good food, great atmosphere.1	1
You can't beat that.	1
Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was Luke warm, Our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.	0

She ordered a toasted English muffin that came out untoasted.	0
I want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service.	1
2 times - Very Bad Customer Service !	0
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
Con: spotty service.	0
The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"	0
The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	1
Our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff.	1
Don't bother coming here.	0
Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!	0

I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!	1

Fantastic food!	1
The service here leaves a lot to be desired.	0
The Veggitarian platter is out of this world!	1
The place was fairly clean but the food simply wasn't worth it.	0
The grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning.	1
The croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus.	1
Terrible service!	0
I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!	1
Hell no will I go back	0
So they performed.	1
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	1
Spend your money and time some place else.	0
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	0
Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!	1
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	1
I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	1
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	0
Awful service.	0
The salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop, which was perfectly cooked.	1
The desserts were a bit strange.	0
I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	0
The food was very good and I enjoyed every mouthful, an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc.	1
What a mistake that was!	0
This is some seriously good pizza and I'm an expert/connisseur on the topic.	1
Best tacos in town by far!!	1

I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	0
I really enjoyed eating here.	1
Nice, spicy and tender.	1
This place is way too overpriced for mediocre food.	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	1
It was way over fried.	0
The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!	0
Main thing I didn't enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd, around mid 30s and up.	0
Do not waste your money here!	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
Ryan's Bar is definitely one Edinburgh establishment I won't be revisiting.	0
After one bite, I was hooked.	1
This place is horrible and way overpriced.	0
Pretty awesome place.	1
I'd rather eat airline food, seriously.	0
So in a nutshell: 1) The restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer.	0
Service is quick and friendly.	1
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
This is a good joint.	1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
The dining space is tiny, but elegantly decorated and comfortable.	1
Perfect for someone (me) who only likes beer ice cold, or in this case, even colder.	1
Sauce was tasteless.	0
Unfortunately, it was not good.	0
The restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it.	1
We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	0
dont go here.	0
Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	1
-Drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point.	0
All of the tapas dishes were delicious!	1
Went in for happy hour, great list of wines.	1
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good.	1
Delicious and I will absolutely be back!	1
This place has it!	1
I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine.	0
The poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying.	0
The food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable.	1
Great Subway, in fact it's so good when you come here every other Subway will not meet your expectations.	1
As for the service: I'm a fan, because it's quick and you're being served by some nice folks.	1
Won't ever go here again.	0
My side Greek salad with the Greek dressing was so tasty, and the pita and hummus was very refreshing.	1
It was awesome.	1
Also, I feel like the chips are bought, not made in house.	0
I was shocked because no signs indicate cash only.	0
The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing.	1
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	1
Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	0
I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	0
